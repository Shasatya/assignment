# Logo Image

Please add your logo image file here.

## File Requirements:
- **File name**: `logo.png` (or `logo.jpg`, `logo.svg`)
- **Recommended size**: 48x48px to 96x96px (will be scaled automatically)
- **Format**: PNG (with transparency), JPG, or SVG

## Supported formats:
- PNG (recommended for logos with transparency)
- JPG
- SVG (scalable vector graphics)

## How to add:
1. Save your logo image file as `logo.png` (or `logo.jpg`/`logo.svg`)
2. Place it in this directory: `/public/images/logo.png`
3. The logo will automatically appear in the Navbar

## Current implementation:
The logo is used in:
- Main Navbar (desktop and mobile)
- Next.js Image component with automatic optimization

## Notes:
- The image will be automatically optimized by Next.js
- If you use a different filename, update `components/Navbar.tsx` line ~150
- For best results, use PNG with transparent background
